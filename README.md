# pyenv-package-test

By using the `pyenv-package-test`,
you can test your Python library
with different Python versions **for each bugfix version**.

Tests are performed using `pytest`,
which requires the `pytest-dashboard` plugin to be installed.
Therefore, your package to be tested should have dependencies on `pytest-dashboard` and `pytest`.

`pytest-dashboard` provides real-time progress reporting of tests
being executed through the `progress.yaml` file
and has the ability to aggregate them.
`pyenv-package-test` automates the process of reading and aggregating `progress.yaml` files
generated by tests run in multiple `pyenv` environments.
